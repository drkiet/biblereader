# Project Bible Reader
This project is based on the Speed Reader project that I created to help me with daily reading. I was also inspired by many scripture scholars who can decode 'some' of the mystery of the words of God (Jn 21:25).

This software aims to help the beginners of scripture study. There are many well-developed software in the marketplace for more advanced scripture scholars. This may not meet the needs of these advanced individuals.

The code remains a 'hack'. I am spending time to improve by refactoring the code. This process is tedious and time-consuming. 

More documentation is to follow. I promise.
